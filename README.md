# What's this?

_#MissingTypes_ is a small software that removes all _A_, _B_ and _O_ from a text. It has been created specifically for the [#MissingTypes](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23missingtypes&src=typd) operation, which attempts to make people aware of the importance of giving blood by removing any blood types in texts.
